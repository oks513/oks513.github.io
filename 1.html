<h2>Early life </h2>
<p>Stirling is the middle child of three daughters of Stephen and Diane Stirling.
Stirling describes her childhood as being raised in a modest household
and stated "I would not trade my humble childhood years for anything else."[16]
Due to her family's financial limitations, her parents could only afford to find a violin teacher
who would give her half lessons. Although they were told by instructors that "a child isn't going to learn
how to play in 15 minutes a week", her parents persisted, and at the age of five she began taking violin lessons.[17]</p>
<p>Living in Gilbert, Arizona, Stirling attended Greenfield Junior High, and at age sixteen,[18]
Stirling attended Mesquite High School and joined four friends in a rock band called Stomp on Melvin.
As part of her experience with the group, Stirling wrote a solo violin rock song,
and her performance helped her to win the state title of Arizona's Junior Miss and claim the
Spirit Award in the America's Junior Miss Finals competition.[19] Stirling was also a member of
 Charley Jenkins Band for about a year.[20]</p>
<p>From a young age, Stirling had a fascination for dance, and desired to take both dancing
and violin lessons. In an interview with NewMediaRockstars, she said, "...ever since
I was a kid, I've always wished that I could dance, but my parents said, 'You [can] choose
violin or you [can] choose dance, but we can't afford both', and I chose violin. So this is
 kind of a fulfillment – it's funny to say, but this is something I've always wanted to do."[21]
Stirling registered her YouTube channel on May 20, 2007, under the username lindseystomp</p>
<h2>Personal life</h2>
<p>Stirling attended Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah, to study film making.[16]
She later served as a missionary in New York City for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
(LDS Church).[136][137] A story she wrote about her mission was later published in the compilation Do Not Attemp
in Heels: Mission Stories and Advice from Sisters Who've Been There.[138] Stirling returned to Provo in 2009 to
continue studying at BYU. She then moved back to Arizona, in December 2012, to be with her family. In August 2015,
she graduated from the BYU Marriott School of Management with a Bachelor of Science degree in recreation management.[139]
She resides in Los Angeles.[140]<br><br>
For a short time she dated film maker Devin Graham, who had attended the same university and church.[141] The two
began dating shortly after the filming of "Crystallize" and Graham moved to Utah.[142][143] The two have since
ended their professional and personal relationship.[143] In October 2017, on "Dancing with the Stars" Stirling
revealed her year and a half relationship with Ryan Weed ended.[144]<br><br>
Stirling has publicly spoken about her battle with anorexia. She discovered her disorder while working for a
treatment center for troubled girls. Stirling said in an interview with Good Morning America that her
song "Shatter Me" was "actually my story of overcoming my eating disorder".[145] The cover art of the
album is a reference to her struggle which showcases a "seemingly perfect-looking ballerina standing in the
middle of a cracked glass globe".[146] In 2013, Stirling was featured by the LDS Church in its I'm a Mormon
campaign in which she spoke openly about how her faith helped in her battle during high
school and college.[16][142] On November 25, 2014, she performed and answered questions in a
live world broadcast to LDS youth.[147] A one-hour video recording of the event was featured on the
LDS Church home page.[148]<br><br>

Stirling has a celestial body named after her, Asteroid 242516 Lindseystirling, about 2–3 km diameter,
semi-major axis of 2.72AU, eccentricity of 0.051, inclined 3.7 degrees to ecliptic.[149]
